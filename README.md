 ## Clustering Job Titles


This document explains how to cluster list of job titles.
Steps I have followed 
    1.Taking random sample from the list of jobs and  tokenizing each title
    2.Vectorizing the titles using tf-idf vectorization technique
    3.calculate distance b/n each titles and create distance matrix
    4.Find optimal k using silhouette scores for each sample
    5.cluster using k-means Algorithm
    6.Reduce dimentionality using 
    7.Plot k-mean cluster output
    8.Apply hierarchical clustering on the titles using Ward clustering
    9.plot the dendogram
